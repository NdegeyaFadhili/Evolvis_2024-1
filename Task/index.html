                Jesse Danneck's Portfolio 

    Hello! I'm Jesse Danneck, a 18-year-old student at Mother Merry School in Kigali City,
      currently studying computer programming at Evolvis. My passion for technology drives 
      me to dive deep into programming languages and software development, and I love the challenge 
      of creating and optimizing code.
      In addition to my studies, I'm an active member of the robotics club at school
      where I apply my programming skills to build and control robots.
      I also stay engaged with athletics, 

      Iâ€™m excited about the future and eager to leverage my skills in computer programming 
      to drive innovation and make a positive impact in my community and beyond.
